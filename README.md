# alpha


Alpha is a deruled meta-controller of access, information, processes.


1st Principle: everything is an event.

Corollary: everything is recordable* therefore recorded, backwardable and forwardable in time.

* the surplus which is not recordable (the universe itself) falls outside the scope of the meta-control


2nd Principle: everything is a service.

Corollary: everything can be connected to everything, speak to everything, listen to everything.



Required features:

+ control over access: who is accessing, when, what
+ control over information: what was written, where, when, by whom
+ control over processes: what is running, where, when it started, by whom started, who/what interacts with who/what



Technologies

Distributed-first



Issues

+ How does the database look like? Is it a database?
+ Where is everything deployed?
+ How is the project bootstrapped - to be able to modify the project and record the modification.
+ What language(s) is(are) used? Rust? C++? Denatural?
